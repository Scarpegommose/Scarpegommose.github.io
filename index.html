    <h1>Bubbles: A Free Visual Timer Designed for ADHD Time Blindness</h1>
    <p>If you have ADHD, "I must finish this task in 15 minutes" means absolutely nothing. This is what "time blindness" means.<br>
Bubbles is designed to turn time into something you can easily visualize. <br>
You create bubbles with a set duration, and they gradually become smaller to let you understand at a glance how much time you have left.<br>
Suddenly, time starts making sense. <br>"I must finish this task before the bubble pops" may seem like a small difference to you, but to your brain it's like day and night.</p>
    <p>Bubbles: Visual Timer is entirely free. You can download it from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marcogodano.bubbles1">Google Play Store</a></p>
